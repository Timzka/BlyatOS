BlyatOS: because other operating systems are just not made for gopniks!
Faster than your coffee – boots in milliseconds.  
Smokes a Cigarette on Startup for peak Efficiency!  
No distractions – Tetris included, GUI excluded.
Stable as a brick – crashes are for amateurs.  
Minimalist glory like in soviet times – ASCII art > fancy graphics.  
Use BlyatOS responsibly: once you go Blyat, you never go back.
